# Bug Fixes and UI Improvements Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **2FA Verification Error - "Verification failed. Please try again."**

#### Problem Identified:
- The 2FA component was calling `verifyTwoFactor()` function which doesn't exist
- The correct function name in AuthContext is `verify2FA()`

#### Solution Applied:
```javascript
// BEFORE (incorrect):
const { verifyTwoFactor, logout, loading } = useAuth()
const result = await verifyTwoFactor(code)

// AFTER (corrected):
const { verify2FA, logout, loading } = useAuth()
const result = await verify2FA(code)
```

#### Additional Improvements:
- Added better error handling with console logging
- Enhanced error message display with fallback text
- Improved error propagation from the API response

### 2. **Oversized Form Elements**

#### Problems Identified:
- Form containers were too large (`max-w-md` → `max-w-xs/sm`)
- Font sizes were unnecessarily large (text-3xl → text-xl)
- Padding and spacing were excessive
- Icons and buttons were oversized

#### Solutions Applied:

#### **Container Sizing:**
```css
/* BEFORE */
max-w-sm sm:max-w-md w-full space-y-6 sm:space-y-8

/* AFTER */
max-w-xs sm:max-w-sm w-full space-y-4 sm:space-y-6
```

#### **Typography Scaling:**
```css
/* Login Page Title: */
text-2xl sm:text-3xl lg:text-4xl → text-xl sm:text-2xl

/* 2FA Page Title: */
text-xl sm:text-2xl lg:text-3xl xl:text-4xl → text-lg sm:text-xl

/* Descriptions: */
text-base sm:text-lg → text-sm sm:text-base
```

#### **Form Elements:**
```css
/* Input Fields: */
py-3 sm:py-4 → py-2.5 sm:py-3
pl-10 sm:pl-12 → pl-8 sm:pl-10

/* 2FA Code Input: */
text-xl sm:text-2xl lg:text-3xl → text-lg sm:text-xl
py-4 sm:py-5 lg:py-6 → py-3 sm:py-4
```

#### **Button Sizing:**
```css
/* Primary Buttons: */
py-3 sm:py-4 → py-2.5 sm:py-3
font-bold → font-semibold

/* Text Sizing: */
text-sm sm:text-base lg:text-lg → text-sm sm:text-base
```

#### **Icon Scaling:**
```css
/* Logo Icons: */
w-16 h-16 sm:w-20 sm:h-20 → w-12 h-12 sm:w-14 sm:h-14
w-8 h-8 sm:w-10 sm:h-10 → w-6 h-6 sm:w-7 sm:h-7

/* Security Badge: */
w-6 h-6 sm:w-8 sm:h-8 → w-5 h-5 sm:w-6 sm:h-6
```

#### **Spacing Optimization:**
```css
/* Container Padding: */
p-4 sm:p-6 lg:p-8 → p-3 sm:p-4

/* Form Spacing: */
space-y-4 sm:space-y-6 → space-y-3 sm:space-y-4

/* Margins: */
mb-4 sm:mb-6 → mb-3 sm:mb-4
```
