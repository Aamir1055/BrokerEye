Fix Client2 module filtering and pagination

Major refactoring to simplify Client2 module and fix filtering issues:

FILTERING FIXES:
- Fixed column header checkbox filters to use correct API format
- Email/Name/Phone filters now send: {"email": "val1,val2,val3"}
- Login filters use mt5Accounts array: {"mt5Accounts": [123, 456, 789]}
- Removed multi-request approach that was making 100+ API calls
- Now makes single API call with comma-separated values
- Removed client-side filtering logic (250+ lines)

PAGINATION FIXES:
- Fixed pagination to work correctly with filters
- Removed logic that fetched all pages and showed on one page
- API now handles pagination properly
- Page numbers display correctly

FACE CARDS FIXES:
- Face cards now show correct totals from API
- Removed client-side total recalculation
- Totals update correctly when filters are applied

PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS:
- Reduced auto-refresh interval from 3 seconds to 30 seconds
- Removed unnecessary API calls (90% reduction)
- Simplified code to match ClientsPage implementation
- Removed 250+ lines of complex filtering code

CODE CLEANUP:
- Removed emailFilterList, nameFilterList, phoneFilterList state
- Removed allFilteredClients, hasClientSideFilters, filteredTotals
- Removed displayedClientCount, displayedTotalPages
- Removed applyClientSideCheckboxFilters function
- Removed buildPayloadVariants function
- Removed multi-request merging logic

Files changed:
- src/pages/Client2Page.jsx (major refactoring)

Testing:
- Column header filters work correctly for all fields
- Pagination works with filters applied
- Face cards show accurate totals
- Single API call per filter operation
- No more 50-request limit errors
