# Enhanced Blue & White Theme UI - Visibility & Visual Appeal Improvements

## Fixed Issues Addressed

### 1. **Text Visibility Problems**
- **Before**: Username, password, and TOTP text were not visible due to poor color contrast
- **After**: Implemented high-contrast text styling with `text-gray-900` for input fields and `text-gray-800` for labels
- **Solution**: Used strong color contrast ratios and proper font weights for maximum readability

### 2. **Basic UI Appearance** 
- **Before**: Simple, flat design that looked "quite normal"
- **After**: Rich, layered design with multiple visual depth techniques while maintaining blue/white theme
